# 🏀 SportsPro Technical Support System

**Developer:** MintBanshee
**Course:** PHP and MySQL Development Project 
**Status:**
  - **Phase 1:** Assignment 2 (Initial Modules) 

## ✨ AI Use
**Documentation:** Co-authored this README with Artemis (Gemini) to organize project goals and instructor notes.

**Syntax & Logic Mentorship:** Used for troubleshooting pathing issues, verifying SQL syntax, and mapping out logical flows (pseudo-code) to ensure professional structure and UI/UX consistency while maintaining a "Do not give me coding" rule.

## 🌿 Project Goals
This is a PHP/MySQL application for tracking technical support incidents. 

## 📝 Dev-Student Notes
- integrated search customers feature on to customers manager to reduce redunancy
- added back button to the additional search page accessed from the view/update customer page for ease of use
- manually seeded Japan the database to allow Japan (JP) as a country and added Japan to the dropdown menu

### Previous Focus (Assignment 2)
- Initialize the tech_support database. 
- Create the Product Manager and Technician Manager modules. 
- Build the core MVC scaffold (Model-View-Controller).

### Current Focus (Assignment 3)
- ensure products manager is fully functional
- ensure technicians manager is fully functional
- ensure customers manager is fully functional

### What is to Come
As I progress through Assignments I will be adding:
- User authentication and secure logins. 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refactoring. 
- Enhanced data validation and secure HTTPS connections.
