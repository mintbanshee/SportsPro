# 🏀 SportsPro Technical Support System

**Developer:** MintBanshee
**Course:** PHP and MySQL Development Project 
**Status:**
  - **Phase 3:** Assignment 4 (Login and Register Product) 

## ✨ AI Use
**Documentation:** Co-authored this README with Artemis (Gemini) to organize project goals and instructor notes.

**Syntax & Logic Mentorship:** Used for troubleshooting pathing issues, verifying SQL syntax, and mapping out logical flows (pseudo-code) to ensure professional structure and UI/UX consistency while maintaining a "Do not give me coding" rule.

**Hey Artemis! I'd like to make it so THIS happens for user flow but I don't know how, can you give me directions without giving me code please?** 

## 🌿 Project Goals
This is a PHP/MySQL application for tracking technical support incidents. 

## 📝 Dev-Student Notes
- integrated search customers feature on to customers manager to reduce redunancy
- added back button to the additional search page accessed from the view/update customer page for ease of use
- manually seeded Japan the database to allow Japan (JP) as a country and added Japan to the dropdown menu
- added Register Another Product and Cancel button for better user experience
- added success and error alerts for better user experience including adding a check for if product is already registered
- added admin ability to edit user information and role

### Previous Focus (Assignment 2 & 3)
- Initialize the tech_support database. 
- Create the Product Manager and Technician Manager modules. 
- Build the core MVC scaffold (Model-View-Controller).
- ensure products manager is fully functional
- ensure technicians manager is fully functional
- ensure customers manager is fully functional

### What is to Come
